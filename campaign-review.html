                <p>A fantastic satire on the state of politics in 2012 was undoubtedly The Campaign, starring Will Ferrell and Zach Galifianakis.
                    In addition, it foresaw the future of politics with absolute accuracy. I don't want to go political, but it's amazing to see how much political hilarity is still 
                    present in today's political discussions, especially in South Carolina. Both sad and frightening, really.
                    They truly don't create comedy movies like this any more, don't get me wrong streaming platforms are great but I've had it up to here with some of them. 
                    I have never watched a comedy from the past several years that had me gasping for air as much as this one did. I can't recall the last time I watched a movie 
                    with a serious premise that also had humorous moments that were based on the characters and story. These days, everything revolves on parties, drug use, references, 
                    being woke, or things blowing up. And even though I love those kinds of movies, it's nice to watch one that openly criticizes the government and essentially makes 
                    fun of politics the entire time. I watched this movie for the first time when I was in highschool, and sicne then I've seen it numerous times because it's that funny. I'd recommend 
                    this movie to anyone that has a good sense of humor, loves comedy or just needs a picker-upper, you won't regret it. </p>
